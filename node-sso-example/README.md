# Node.js Example App with SSO powered by WorkOS

An example application demonstrating to use the [WorkOS Node SDK](https://github.com/workos/workos-node) to authenticate users via SSO.

## Prerequisites

Node.js version 10+

## Node Project Setup

1. Clone the main repo and install dependencies for the app you'd like to use:

    ```bash
    # HTTPS
    git clone https://github.com/workos/node-example-applications.git
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    # SSH
    git clone git@github.com:workos/node-example-applications.git
    ```

2. Navigate to SSO app within the cloned repo.

    ```bash
    $ cd node-example-applications/node-sso-example
    ```

3. Install the dependencies.
    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```

## Configure your environment

4. Grab your API Key and Client ID from the WorkOS Dashboard. Create a `.env`
   file at the root of the project, and store these like so:
    ```bash
    WORKOS_API_KEY=sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
    WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=project_xxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```

## SSO Setup with WorkOS

5. Follow the [SSO authentication flow instructions](https://workos.com/docs/sso/guide/introduction) to create a new SSO connection in your WorkOS dashboard.

6. Add `http://localhost:8000/callback` as a Redirect URI in the Configuration section of the Dashboard.

7. Update `routes/index.js` with the Organization ID.

## Testing the Integration

8. Start the server and head to `http://localhost:8000/ to begin the login flow!

```sh
npm start
```
